<p>"She wasn't terrifyingly tall, you know. She hadn't the strength either. All words fail to describe her, but fragile goes furthest, I think. She was too sensitive, small and tiny; she was beautiful, the perfect woman for any man to fall in love with, she needed to be treated with care and she needed to treat herself with care, which never agreed with the world we live in, and men... Men love to feel their care is needed, appreciated and requitted, in different forms. I was her counterpart, the mental one." He scoffs at his own words like he could see them staring back at him, sadly.<br>
"I was just as fragile on the inside as she was on the outside, we both were barely held together in one piece, each on his own front. It ruined me from the inside out, how my heart and mind operated, because they were beyond my limited human body to carry out. But I was fierce, I would have suffered for her, I'd have fought, sweat and ached for her protection and happiness."<br>
He now raises his hands as if he's a king returning the greetings of his royal subjects, staring into the open sky as he carries on.
"But, I was a fool, or so everything tends to make me believe. I did notnlove protecting her, caring for her. I was always anxious. I didn't want to be with a Noble Lady, I wanted to be with a Lady Knight. I would fight for yer, but I'd very much like to fight alongside her. The two of us against the world. Like we both were some dashing pirares." His expression suddenly turns grim.<br>
"But these are all dreams and fantasies of a man who was no man in their eyes</p>

  <p>It's a really tough moment, after a day of smiles and jokes and speaking normally and happily, of work achievement and progress and unwavering exertion of effort, no I don't think or have my mind flood with fears and desperately need a drink to shake it off at the expense of a hangover, rather, I feel...
It's a moment when there's no guards at the gate because I'm tired and the rush in as they ram the front gate and assault me and fill every inch of me... and then I feel her; the smell of her when I hugged her, the taste of her lips, the feel of her hands in mine, just as they were in my dreams... and I'm immediately a mad symphony of frost and flame, the cold blizzard of my cold fake robotic nature dancing with the inferno of my feelings, my passion, my desire... and all that would melt, would put off the fires, and all the steam would condense to ice and the cycle remains for as long as it wills itself to as I am its helpless subject.</p></div>
